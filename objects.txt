Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript.

INTRODUCTION :

JAVASCRIPT - The dynamic and versatile programming language, owes much of its power to its ability to handle complex data structures efficiently. At the heart of this capability lies the concept of objects.

OBJECTS in JS - An object is a composite data type that allows you to group related data and functionality together. Objects are essential for modeling real-world entities and organizing code in a modular and reusable way.

1.Properties and Methods:

* Objects in JavaScript consist of properties and methods. 
* Properties are key-value pairs that store data, while methods are functions associated with the object. 
* The internal representation of an object involves the storage and organization of these properties and methods.

2.Memory Allocation:

* When an object is created, memory is allocated to store its properties and methods. 
* Each property is associated with a unique key, and its corresponding value can be of any data type, including other objects. 

3.Reference Types:

* When you create an object, a reference to its location in memory is stored, rather than a direct copy of the object. 
* This reference allows for more efficient memory usage and better performance when working with complex data structures.

4.Prototypes and Inheritance:

* Objects in JavaScript can inherit properties and methods from other objects through a mechanism called prototypes. 
* Each object has an associated prototype, and when a property or method is accessed, JavaScript looks up the prototype chain to find the corresponding value

5.Dynamic Nature:

* Properties and methods can be added, modified, or removed at runtime, providing flexibility in coding and adapting to changing requirements.


CONCLUSION :

Their internal representation involves memory allocation, reference types, prototypes, and a dynamic nature that enables developers to create sophisticated and flexible applications.
